# DaDaDaDemo

DaDaDaDemo is a platform, enabling one to search & participate in or arrange demonstrations.

## Reason for existence
We thought, often people find themselves organizationally lost on platforms such as Facebook 
and Twitter, even though they just want to find or arrange a proper demonstration. 
DaDaDaDemo was a part of the hackathon 'Jugendhackt Berlin 2016'
